A user can sign up for a new account with an email and password.


An existing user can sign in



If a user is not signed in, they only see a welcome message on the home page.




If a user is signed in, they can see all users on the home page.



A user can sign out using the provided delete route which is from a hidden field in the form.



A helper method current_user returns the current signed in user and is used to display appropriate sign in / sign out portions of the view. (This logic is already implemented in the view - you just need to finish the helper method).
